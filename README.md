# Welcome to marimo!

[**marimo**](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) is the next generation
of Python notebooks — reactive, reproducible, and reusable. Run a cell or
interact with a UI element, and marimo automatically runs dependent cells (or
marks them as stale), keeping code and outputs consistent. marimo notebooks are
stored as pure Python, executable as scripts, and deployable as apps.

Here's a guide to our GitHub organization:

-   🍃 Check out our [main repo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) for
    installation instructions, [docs](https://docs.marimo.io), and bite-sized [usage examples](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/tree/main/examples).
-   🧩 Use
    [templates](https://github.com/orgs/marimo-team/repositories?q=template%3Atrue+archived%3Afalse)
    to get started with [publishing to GitHub pages](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo-gh-pages-template), organizing projects [with `uv`](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo-uv-starter-template),
    and more.
-   📚 Browse [example notebooks](https://github.com/marimo-team/examples) for
    starting points for your own explorations, experiments, and tools.
-   ✨ Get inspired by [awesome projects](https://github.com/marimo-team/awesome-marimo) from our [awesome community](https://github.com/marimo-team/spotlights).
