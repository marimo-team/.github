# Welcome to marimo!

[**marimo**](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) is the next generation
of Python notebooks ‚Äî reactive, reproducible, and reusable. Run a cell or
interact with a UI element, and marimo automatically runs dependent cells (or
marks them as stale), keeping code and outputs consistent. marimo notebooks are
stored as pure Python, executable as scripts, and deployable as apps.

Here's a guide to our GitHub organization:
